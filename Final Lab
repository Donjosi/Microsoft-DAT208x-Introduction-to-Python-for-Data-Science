"""Read and explore your data
In this lab, you'll explore a dataset containing information on a university's recent 
graduates for each department. 
The URL this dataset can be downloaded from is stored in a variable called recent_grads_url. 
In this exercise, you'll read in this data using Python's pandas module."""


# Import pandas 
import pandas as pd

# Use pandas to read in recent_grads_url
recent_grads = pd.read_csv(recent_grads_url)

# Print the shape
print(recent_grads.shape)


""Exploring Your Data
Now you'll perform some data exploration using the Python pandas module. To get a sense of the data, 
you'll output statistics such as mean, median, count, and percentiles."""

# Print .dtypes
print(recent_grads.dtypes)

# Output summary statistics
print(recent_grads.describe())

# Exclude data of type object
print(recent_grads.describe(exclude=['object']))
